##  Analysis 

- It was interesting that the population of bike riders scewed heavily toward males. This may be that females may not feel as confortable riding bikes to work or tp get to placing they need to go and may be more leisure bike travelors. 

- As expected the Spring and Summer months are when the majority of rides occured. Surprisingly Fall didn't see a bounce back or the continued amount of rides from the hot/humid Summer months as I would have thought. 

- The customer base seems to also be the majority of people who have some permanent residence in New York, as subscribers held the over whelming majority of riders. Initially, I thought this would be a lack of tourist riders, but it is in all likelyhood that they do not make very many rides while on their trip. And permanet residence make much more rides throughout the year scewing the number. Sales data of passes sold would be a good start to further more tell the story.
